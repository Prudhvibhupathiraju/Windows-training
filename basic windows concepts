-------

desktop - desktop comes under client operations which sends requests to the server

server - server is a software or hardware that accepts and responds to the requests that are made over the network

client - the device that makes the requests and recieves the response from the server is known as clinet

different types of servers
----------
1) Tower server
2) Rack server
3) blade server
4) virtual machine
---------

Tower servers
-----------
- tower server looks same as the desktop setup
- it used for small web based applications
- it used for higher performance than the server
- tower servers are most basic type of servers
pros
- tower servers can be cutomized and upgrades based on necessity 
- tower servers are cheapest, hence they are cost effective.
- tower server has low overall component density, hence it cools down quickly.
cons
- these servers occupy good amont of physical space and are difficult to manage physically
- tower server is ideal for small buisiness that have limited clients
-----------

Rack servers
-----------
- rack servers are physically smaller than the tower servers and place inside the rack.
- these racks are similar that of the racks where we store set of files and folders.
- A rack server is positioned vertically over another rack server along with storage units, cooling systems, etc
pros
- we can easily replace malfunctioning server with another
- management tools in racks makes it easy and efficient to organize racks
- it is very cost effective
cons
- rack servers consume more power
- requires high maintenance
-----------

Blade servers
-----------
- blade servers are the latest and most advanced type of serversin the market.
- these servers are the smallest servers and used for conserving space.
- we can add and remove the server in blade server system without turning off the system.
pros
- In a blade server you can connect through a single interface making the monitoring and maintenance easy.
cons
- expensive configurations
----------

Virtual Machine
--------
- A virtual machine is a computing environment that functions as a an isolated system with its own CPU, memory, network interface and storage. created from pool hardware resources
- software called hypervisor enacbles the creation and management of hardware resources.
- servers can run multiple Operating system on the single physical server.
- Using hypervisor console we manage, monitor and control virtual machines from a single console
- it is a less cost
- we can enhance the server configuration online as per requirement.
---------

IDRAC
-----------
- The Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) is designated for secure local and remote server management that helps IT administrators to deploy, update and monitor PowerEdge servers
- IDRAC is module in-built in server which can be accessed from IDRAC port through web console.
-----------

ILO
--------
- Integrated Lights-out (iLO) is a remote server management processor that used to monitor HP servers
